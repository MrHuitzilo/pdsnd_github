### Project Title
Understanding bikeshare data in the U.S.

### Description
We use Python to understand, explore and analyze bikeshare data in the U.S.
The code will take user input and provide the option to narrow down data.  
An output of statistics will be provided back to the user based on their input.
In addition to statistics the user will also have the option to view raw data,
which will be displayed in increments of five lines at a time and until the
no longer wants to view data.
